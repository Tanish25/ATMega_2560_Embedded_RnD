Analysis using LEDs:

1)Determination of Time Constant:
The exact time constant cant be determined visually given that the persistence of vision for a human eye is around 60ms. This is the effect of the same principle used in movies, where frames are loaded at a speed higher than that which the human eye can perceive. The blinking of the LED was still perceived at a time period of around 200ms and then gradually it became more difficult to perceive the blinking. The theoretical time constant of an LED is somewhere around 100ms.

2)When frequency is set at 1 kHz, and duty cycle is varied.. the intensity of glow is proportional to the duty cycle. The blinking can't be observed as this frequency is higher than that which the human eye can perceive. The persistence of vision for a normal human eye is around 16 Hz = 0.0625 seconds = 62.5 ms.

3)Determination of internal resistance of the LED:
Output pin on the arduino gives an output voltage of around 5V
Resistance connected with the LED:
Current passing through the LED:
max current LED can tolerate:
Resistance offered within the board(if any):
